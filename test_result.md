No JavaScript errors detected. The complete patient storage workflow is now functional. Minor issue: Save Patient modal behavior needs final verification but core functionality is working."

    message: "🚀 NEW PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED! Major redesign with separate Patient and Visit entities is working perfectly. ✅ All 5 new endpoints tested successfully: POST /api/patients/search-patients (search by name/MRN/phone), POST /api/patients/create-new (creates patient + initial visit), POST /api/patients/add-visit (adds visits to existing patients), GET /api/patients/{mrn}/details (patient with all visits), POST /api/visits/search (search by visit code). ✅ Database collections verified: patients_new (2 patients with MRNs), visits (2 visits with codes). ✅ MRN format: MRN1234567, Visit codes: VAB1234. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with legacy saved_patients collection. ✅ Authentication and error handling working correctly. Minor issues: Visit code validation strict (max 8 chars), legacy search expects search_term parameter. Core functionality is fully operational."

    message: "🚨 NEW PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRONTEND CRITICAL ISSUE: Frontend login functionality is completely broken, blocking access to all NEW patient management features. Backend authentication API is working perfectly (confirmed via curl - returns valid JWT token and user data for drsmith/password123), but frontend login process fails to redirect to main interface after successful authentication. The login button click does not trigger proper state change or navigation, keeping users stuck on login page. This prevents testing of all implemented NEW Patient Management System features: New vs Existing Patient Choice modal, Patient Search functionality, MRN-based patient creation, and Visit tracking system. All features are implemented in code but inaccessible due to login barrier. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FRONTEND LOGIN DEBUGGING AND FIX."

    message: "🎯 COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT MANAGEMENT TESTING COMPLETED! ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS: Login functionality now working correctly with drsmith/password123. ✅ CORE FEATURES WORKING: Patient information form (Sarah Johnson, 28, Female, 165cm, 60kg, 118/78), medical history text areas, demo mode with medication extraction (metformin, lisinopril), medication templates interface, and review section navigation all functional. ✅ SAVE WORKFLOW PARTIALLY WORKING: Save Patient button found and accessible in review section, but critical integration issue remains. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Recent Patients section not displaying saved patients due to 422 API errors from /api/patients/search-patients endpoint. Backend logs show patient saved (code: GX817790) but frontend cannot retrieve patients for display. The save action works but Recent Patients dashboard integration is broken, preventing the complete workflow from functioning as intended. REQUIRES API ENDPOINT DEBUGGING."

    message: "🚨 MED TEMPLATES SYSTEM CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: Comprehensive testing reveals Load Disease Template section is completely missing from prescription workflow HTML. Root cause identified: Template section is conditionally rendered based on (diagnosis || medications.length > 0) but these React state variables are not properly populated when navigating to review page. Console logs show diagnosis and medications are extracted during demo consultation, but React state is not updated for the review page. Fixed QuickTemplateLoader API response handling, but main issue is state management during navigation between views. Template section code exists (lines 5527-5554) but condition fails at runtime. REQUIRES STATE MANAGEMENT FIX for diagnosis and medications to persist across navigation."

    message: "🎉 MED TEMPLATES SYSTEM FULLY FIXED AND TESTED! ✅ NAVIGATION BUG COMPLETELY RESOLVED: Med Templates → Create Template → Back to Templates List flow works perfectly without previous back button issues. ✅ INTEGRATED FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: '📋 Use Template' button successfully integrated next to '+ Add Medication' button in AI-Extracted Clinical Data section during prescription workflow. ✅ SEPARATE LOADER REMOVED: Confirmed removal of separate '🏥 Load Disease Template' section - templates now only accessible through integrated button. ✅ TEMPLATE CREATION FUNCTIONAL: Disease-specific dropdown (Hypertension/Diabetes/UTI), medication builder with drug name/dosage/frequency fields, template visibility settings working. ✅ SEAMLESS INTEGRATION: Templates accessible during prescribing through integrated '📋 Use Template' button, opens templates list for loading. All critical navigation bugs fixed, integration streamlined, and workflow intuitive as requested."
