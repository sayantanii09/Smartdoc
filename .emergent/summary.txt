The trajectory outlines an iterative development process, transforming a simple, non-functional React application into a sophisticated, full-stack medical documentation tool named SmartDoc Pro. The process began with extracting a GitHub repository. Initial user requests focused on fixing fundamental issues: making the application previewable by installing dependencies and correcting the file structure, and then fixing the visual appearance by setting up Tailwind CSS.

As the basic application became functional, the user's requirements grew in complexity, evolving the project significantly. Feature requests drove the addition of missing UI components like settings, vitals, and allergy sections. Subsequent feedback identified bugs in the AI-driven transcription and medication parsing, which led to refactoring the frontend logic.

A pivotal moment was the user's request for multi-doctor support, which necessitated a major architectural shift. The AI engineer built a secure FastAPI backend with MongoDB for user authentication (registration/login) and persistent data storage, converting the project from a frontend-only application to a robust full-stack system. This involved implementing JWT for session management and tackling backend-frontend integration challenges like CORS.

The final phase focused on professionalizing the application by adding PDF generation, UX improvements like hover tooltips, and expanding the drug database. The last user requests involved integrating a comprehensive Medscape-level drug database and renaming the project, indicating a push towards a production-ready MVP. The AI was in the middle of addressing the project rename when the trajectory ended.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build SmartDoc Pro, a professional-grade, AI-powered medical documentation and prescription application for healthcare professionals.

**Core Features Implemented:**
- **Secure Multi-Doctor Platform:** Doctors must create an account and log in to use the system. Credentials (name, degree, registration number, organization) are securely stored in a database.
- **AI-Powered Voice Transcription:** The system transcribes a doctor's spoken consultation in real-time.
- **Intelligent Data Extraction:** The application parses the transcript to automatically populate patient information, medical history, vitals, allergies, and prescriptions.
- **Comprehensive Patient Forms:** Includes fields for patient demographics (name, age, gender, height, weight), medical history (past conditions, surgeries), and social history (smoking, alcohol, exercise).
- **Advanced Prescription Module:**
    - Captures medication name, dosage, form (tablet, IV), route, and food instructions.
    - Expands common medical abbreviations (e.g., OD to Once Daily).
- **Drug Interaction Database:** The system maintains a database of drugs and their classes to check for potential interactions.
- **Professional Output:**
    - Generates a downloadable/printable PDF of the final prescription, auto-populated with the doctor's details, patient information, and the current date/time.
    - Includes a placeholder for future EHR (Electronic Health Record) submission.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, modern UI with clear iconography and helpful tooltips for icon-only buttons.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Database:** MongoDB for persistent storage of user accounts and drug data.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless user sessions. Password hashing is done using .
- **Frontend:** React for UI, Tailwind CSS for styling, and  for client-side PDF generation.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for building RESTful APIs, Pydantic for data validation, and Motor for asynchronous interaction with MongoDB.
- **Process Management:** Supervisor is used to manage and run the frontend, backend, and MongoDB services.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application transitioned from a single React app to a full-stack architecture with separate frontend and backend services.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the core, monolithic frontend component. It manages the entire application's state and UI, including routing between different views like login, registration, the main documentation interface, and the final review screen.
  - **Changes:** This file has undergone extensive modifications. It was initially a simple UI display. It was refactored to include: state management for all patient and doctor data, logic for handling voice transcription, API calls to the backend for authentication and data handling, UI for all new features (vitals, medical history, settings), and the implementation of PDF generation and hover tooltips.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file contains the entire FastAPI backend application. It defines all API endpoints, handles database connections, and manages user authentication logic.
  - **Changes:** This file was created from scratch to support the multi-doctor requirement. It establishes a connection to MongoDB, sets up CORS middleware, and implements crucial endpoints like  for creating new doctor accounts with hashed passwords, and  for verifying credentials and issuing JWT access tokens. It also includes logic for seeding and resetting the drug database.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file is critical for frontend-backend communication. It stores the URL of the backend API.
  - **Changes:** This file was created to solve a CORS issue where the frontend was incorrectly trying to call . It was updated to use the correct proxy route (), ensuring that frontend requests are correctly routed to the backend service.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file was created as a placeholder to implement a more robust solution for integrating comprehensive medical data, as requested by the user.
  - **Changes:** The file was just created and is currently empty. It represents the starting point for the Medscape-level data integration task.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Medscape Data Integration:** The user explicitly requested a comprehensive drug database equivalent to Medscape, rather than manually adding drugs. A placeholder file () has been created but the actual integration logic is not implemented.
- **Project Renaming:** The user asked to rename the project from git-puller-8 to SmartDoc Pro. This task was started but not completed.
- **EHR Integration:** The UI includes buttons and sections for EHR (Electronic Health Record) integration, but the backend logic and API connections to actually submit data to an EHR system are not implemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on two parallel user requests.

First, the user requested **COMPLETE MEDSCAPE DATA INTEGRATION,** expressing dissatisfaction with the manual addition of drugs to the database. In response, the engineer created a new file, , to house the logic for this feature and installed necessary Python libraries (, ). This task is in its nascent stage, with only the initial file setup completed.

Second, the user asked **HOW CAN I CHANGE NAME OF THE PROJECT FROM GIT-PULLER-8 TO SmartDoc Pro**. The engineer began to address this by reading the contents of  to identify one of the locations where the project name is defined.

The very last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer initiating a call to the Deployer Agent to run a health check. This was an autonomous action by the agent, not a direct user request, likely to assess the application's state before proceeding with the complex pending tasks. The current state is awaiting the results of this health check while the renaming and data integration tasks are paused.

<optional_next_step>
Continue the project renaming process by editing the  field in  from smartdoc to smartdoc-pro and identifying other configuration files that require updating.
